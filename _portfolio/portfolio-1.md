- Investigated two and three-flavor Neutrino Oscillations, specifically with consideration to matter effects.

- Engaged with Conceptual Design Reports(CDR) and Technical Design Reports(TDR) for: DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) and LBNF (Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility), with a particular focus on detector design and functionality.

- Currently, I'm involved in the neutrino flux modeling for Far Detector(FD). (GENIE, LArSoft, GEANT4)
