I've embarked on an exciting project focused on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its capabilities for Time Series Observation (TSO):

- Explored the intricacies of the JWST Pipeline for Time Series Observation, gaining a deep understanding of its working and implementation.

- Successfully generated the desired Data Products by executing the JWST Pipeline on simulated data.

- Currently, I'm engaged in the simulation of Time Series Observation data for the JWST using the powerful MIRAGE tool.
