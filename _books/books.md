## Physics

<!-- ### For College Students -->

**_For College Students:_** Introductory and Advanced Text for College Students: This section includes books suitable for college students looking to master the subject proficiently.

**Classical Mechanics**
   - Author: H. Goldstein
   - Description: This book is *NOT* intended for students who haven't yet completed a basic classical mechanics course. It's best suited for those who have a solid grasp of fundamental concepts like momentum, torque, and moment of inertia within the context of elementary classical mechanics. This book stands out as a rigorous mathematical resource and is an indispensable addition to anyone's classical mechanics studies. Without it, your understanding of classical mechanics may remain incomplete. I strongly recommend this book to undergraduate students in their second year. While it demands a high patience and effort, the rewards are well worth it. To fully benefit from this book, active engagement is essential. You'll need to work through problems and exercises as there's no substitute for hands-on learning.

**Special Relativity**
   - Author: AP French
   - Description: Of all books which I have read on relativity, this is the best which stuits for a college studnet as an introductory course on Special Relativity. This gives a detailed account of all scietific events and discovories in chronological order which slowly led to relativiy. This unique approach of this book also maked you aware how research was being carried on in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It will make feel in those era and will make you understand how one theory got accepted and then later proved to be experimenatlly incorrect. There are a couple of good books out there, but most of them just focuess on teaching the raw concepts fo relativity which is ok. But this book does more. It makes you go through the real way how scientist build special relativity.
