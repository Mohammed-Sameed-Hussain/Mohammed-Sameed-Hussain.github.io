- Investigated two and three-flavor Neutrino Oscillations, specifically with consideration to matter effects.

- Engaged with Conceptual Design Reports for: DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) and LBNF (Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility), with a particular focus on detector design and functionality.

- Currently, I'm involved in the simulation of detector responses for neutrino interactions. This forms a significant part of my ongoing project.(GEANT4, PANDORA, GENIE)
