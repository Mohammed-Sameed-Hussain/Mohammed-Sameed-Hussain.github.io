## Physics

<!-- ### For College Students -->

**_For College Students:_** Introductory and Advanced Text for College Students: This section includes books suitable for college students looking to master the subject proficiently.

**Classical Mechanics**
   - Author: *H. Goldstein*
   - Description: This book is *NOT* intended for students who haven't yet completed a basic classical mechanics course. It's best suited for those who have a solid grasp of fundamental concepts like momentum, torque, and moment of inertia within the context of elementary classical mechanics. This book stands out as a rigorous mathematical resource and is an indispensable addition to anyone's classical mechanics studies. Without it, your understanding of classical mechanics may remain incomplete. I strongly recommend this book to undergraduate students in their second year. While it demands a high patience and effort, the rewards are well worth it. To fully benefit from this book, active engagement is essential. You'll need to work through problems and exercises as there's no substitute for hands-on learning.

**Special Relativity**
   - Author: *A.P. French*
   - Description: Among the various books I've explored on the topic of relativity, this one stands out as the ideal choice for college students embarking on an introductory journey into Special Relativity. It offers a comprehensive account of scientific events and discoveries, presented in chronological order, that gradually paved the way for the development of relativity theory. What truly sets this book apart is its unique approach, immersing readers in the scientific landscape of the late 1800s and early 1900s. As you delve into its pages, you'll find yourself transported to that era, gaining insights into how theories were formulated, accepted, and eventually found experimentally flawed. While there are several good books available, many focus solely on teaching the fundamental concepts of relativity, which is valuable in its own right. However, this particular book goes beyond that by guiding you through the authentic process scientists followed in constructing the foundations of special relativity. Moreover, completing this book and diligently practicing its exercises will provide you with a much deeper understanding of relativity, both conceptually and mathematically.
